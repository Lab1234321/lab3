## Note
1. The task is stored in a txt file. If you want to run this project, you should modify the path of the file which is stored in a variable "DATAPATH" in "src/littlemylyn/entity/TaskManager.java"<br><br>

## TODO  
1.If you want to save tasks to database, you can modify the method "saveTaskList" in "entity/Taskmanager.java". The default method is save the task in a file. And then you should also modify the method "readTaskList" in "entity/TaskManager.java". The method is used to initialize taskList. You'd better just change the body of the method rather then the method signature.<br><br>
2.We should add an icon on toolbar, and bind an action to it so that the eclipse can show the plugin view by clicking the icon.<br><br>
3.Maybe there are bugs, if you find them, just fix them.<br><br>
